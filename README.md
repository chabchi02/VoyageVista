### Timeline

#### September 11-24 Requirements elicitation

During this period, the application features were elicited and the main functions of the application were decided on. The app, at its base, will allow users to navigate hotels, restaurants, and events around them. These features will be made possible with the use of public APIs such as Google Places, Ticketmaster, and Booking.com APIs. After these features are implemented, the goal will be to integrate AI, possibly ChatGPT into the application in the form of an itinerary generator.

Some challenges expected: Integrating data from various public APIs, such as Google Places, Ticketmaster, and Booking.com, can be challenging. These APIs may have different data structures, authentication methods, and usage limitations. Ensuring seamless data retrieval and consistency in data presentation can be a complex task. Comprehensive testing is required to validate the functionality, performance, and security of the application. This includes testing the integration of various APIs and the AI component.
